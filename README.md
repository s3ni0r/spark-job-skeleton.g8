This project is intended for people who know how to use Apache spark and want to get started right away.

You should only need to clone this project if you are modifying the giter8 template.  For information on giter8 templates, please see <http://www.foundweekends.org/giter8/>

## Running

If you want to create a project:

```bash
g8 https://github.com/s3ni0r/spark-job-skeleton.g8
```

## Running locally

If you are testing this giter8 template locally, you should [install g8](http://www.foundweekends.org/giter8/setup.html) and then run the [local test](http://www.foundweekends.org/giter8/testing.html) feature:

```bash
g8 file://spark-job-skeleton.g8/ --name=my-spark-job --force
